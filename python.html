            <p class="mt-5 mb-5 lh-lg lead text-md-start fw-normal"> Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.

                Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
                
                There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different. Python is a widely used programming language that offers several unique features and advantages compared to languages like Java and C++. Our Python tutorial thoroughly explains Python basics and advanced concepts, starting with installation, conditional statements, loops, built-in data structures, Object-Oriented Programming, Generators, Exception Handling, Python RegEx, and many other concepts. This tutorial is designed for beginners and working professionals.

                In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum dreamed of developing Python. The first version of Python 0.9.0 was released in 1991. Since its release, Python started gaining popularity. According to reports, Python is now the most popular programming language among developers because of its high demands in the tech realm.

            <p class="lh-lg lead text-md-start fw-normal">Python is a general-purpose, dynamically typed, high-level, compiled and interpreted, garbage-collected, and purely object-oriented programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. </p>
              <P class="lh-lg lead text-md-start fw-normal">Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, and Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry. Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.</P>

        </div>
        <P class="lh-lg lead text-md-start fw-normal"><b>Easy to use and Read -</b> Python's syntax is clear and easy to read, making it an ideal language for both beginners and experienced programmers. This simplicity can lead to faster development and reduce the chances of errors.
            <br><b>Dynamically Typed -</b> The data types of variables are determined during run-time. We do not need to specify the data type of a variable during writing codes.
           <br> <b>High-level -</b> High-level language means human readable code.
           <br><b> Compiled and Interpreted -</b> Python code first gets compiled into bytecode, and then interpreted line by line. When we download the Python in our system form org we download the default implement of Python known as CPython. CPython is considered to be Complied and Interpreted both.
           <br> <b>Garbage Collected -</b> Memory allocation and de-allocation are automatically managed. Programmers do not specifically need to manage the memory.
           <br> <b>Purely Object-Oriented -</b> It refers to everything as an object, including numbers and strings.
           <br> <b>Cross-platform Compatibility -</b> Python can be easily installed on Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions, allowing developers to create software that runs across different operating systems.
           <br> <b> Rich Standard Library -</b> Python comes with several standard libraries that provide ready-to-use modules and functions for various tasks, ranging from web development and data manipulation to machine learning and networking.
           <br> <b> Open Source -</b> Python is an open-source, cost-free programming language. It is utilized in several sectors and disciplines as a result.</P>

                <h5 class="text-uppercase mb-3 fw-bold ">History of Python </h5> 
            </div>
            <P class="lh-lg lead text-md-start fw-normal"> Python was created by Guido van Rossum. In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, began working on Python while at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. He wanted to create a successor to the ABC programming language that would be easy to read and efficient.

                In February 1991, the first public version of Python, version 0.9.0, was released. This marked the official birth of Python as an open-source project. The language was named after the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus".
                
                Python development has gone through several stages. In January 1994, Python 1.0 was released as a usable and stable programming language. This version included many of the features that are still present in Python today.
                From the 1990s to the 2000s, Python gained popularity for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. In October 2000, Python 2.0 was released. Python 2.0 introduced list comprehensions, garbage collection, and support for Unicode.

In December 2008, Python 3.0 was released. Python 3.0 introduced several backward-incompatible changes to improve code readability and maintainability.

Throughout 2010s, Python's popularity increased, particularly in fields like data science, machine learning, and web development. Its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks made it a favourite among developers.

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) was established in 2001 to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language and its community.
