            <p class="mt-5 mb-5 lh-lg lead text-md-start fw-normal"> JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.

                JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. 
                Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others.
Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.
Imperative language – In this type of language we are mostly concerned about how it is to be done. It simply controls the flow of computation. The procedural programming approach, object, oriented approach comes under this as async await we are thinking about what is to be done further after the async call.
Declarative programming – In this type of language we are concerned about how it is to be done, basically here logical computation requires. Her main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it as the arrow function does.

              </div>
            <p class="lh-lg lead text-md-start fw-normal">JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.

                Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.</p>
              <P class="lh-lg lead text-md-start fw-normal">All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
                JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
                JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
                JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
                It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
                It is a case-sensitive language.
                JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
                It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.</P>

        </div>
        <P class="lh-lg lead text-md-start fw-normal">In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the year 1994, Netscape was founded by Marc Andreessen. He realized that the web needed to become more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language' was believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the company recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed Scheme programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could start, the company merged with Sun Microsystems for adding Java into its Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were there: Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'. Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of Javascript named 'Mocha'. Later, the marketing team replaced the name with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript came into existence.</P>

            <P class="lh-lg lead text-md-start fw-normal">JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:

                <br>Dynamic drop-down menus,
                <br> Displaying date and time,
                <br> Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
                <br> Displaying clocks etc.</p>
